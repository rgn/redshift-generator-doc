= Welcome to the Redshift Generator (Release 1.0) documentation!

This is the automatic start page for version *{page-component-version}* of Redshift Generator.

Redshift Generator is one of two documentation components in the Antora Demo.
The other docs component, Component A, can be accessed via the component selector menu (aka component drawer) at the bottom of the menu on the left side of the page.

== Page source

This page is sourced from the AsciiDoc file named [.path]_index.adoc_ that is located at [.path]_demo-component-b/docs/modules/ROOT/pages_.

=== Why is this the home page of Redshift Generator?

This page is automatically used as the start page of Redshift Generator because it is stored in the ROOT module and named [.path]_index.adoc_.

=== Why is this the home page of the Antora Demo site?
